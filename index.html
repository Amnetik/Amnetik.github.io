                    <h1>About me</h1>
                    <p>I am currently enrolled in my second year of my Master in Computer Science and Embedded Systems at the Evering institute in Mérignac, France. 
                        I enjoy programming and I wish I had the time to create all of my software ideas building up in a way too big to-do list. 
                        I love programming in C# using Visual Studio, and I have gathered a lot of experience with lots of projects and problem solving online (LeetCode / CodeSignal).
                    </p> 
                    <p>   
                        Currently, I am looking to learn new stuff. For instance, I decided to create this website from scratch as a mean to learn Web Development 
                        and programming with HTML and CSS.
                        My next objectives are to learn more about Neural Networks, as I have been taught the basics in class, and also learn how to make Unity application because
                        they seem like a lot of fun and with endless possibilities.
                    </p>
                    <h1>My career</h1>
                    <p>In a near future, I crave for an opportunity to devote my time for a bigger project in a team environment, and learn the best programming habits
                        with experimented engineers. I want to be a Software Development Engineer or an Embedded System Engineer, and my focus is in, but not limited to,
                        the vehicule industry. Nevertheless, I have much to explore and am open to any exciting projects no matter the type of industry. Currently, I feel
                        at home designing User Interface with WPF (Windows Presentation Form) or Windows Forms, and I would love to design digital or analog vehicle
                        dashboard.
