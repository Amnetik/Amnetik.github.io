                                <p>This is a two week project I designed to help me trashtalk my opponents in video games and improve my chances of winning. 
                                    I wanted to create a program that writes a random message out of a CSV file sorted
                                by message categories (Greeting, Comment on shots, etc..) and by message strength (ranked from 1:friendly to 5:mean).
                                </p> 
                                <p>I have designed an original layout using, for the first time, the WPF tool (Windows Presentation Form) on Visual Studio. The graphics are coded
                                    in XAML, a markup language similar to XML or HTML, and the data processing is coded in C#, my language of choice when it comes to 
                                    Desktop applications.
                                </p>

                                <p>The website you are currently reading was a project that lasted about a week. It served a double purpose for me as I tought it would 
                                    be a great way to showcase my ambitions and my qualities as an engineer, but it also allowed me to learn more about
                                    web development.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This project was written using VS Code and uploaded to my github website domain using the Github Desktop software.
                                    It might not use state of the art CSS writing, but I tried to make the website as reponsive as possible,
                                    allowing phones and tablets to access to all the information displayed, as well as desktop computers.

                                <p>This is a month long project that allows for a better showcase of code on Discord messages. Discord has a built-in feature to print text in 
                                    a code box with different coloring as an IDE would do, when specifying the programming language. 
                                    I wanted to make it easier and fully automatic. So I created that Discord Bot that you can invite on your server, on which you can configure
                                    the desired language, and when you send a message, the bot automatically deletes your message, and prints it back in a better format, 
                                    splitting up in multiple messages if necessary. (Discord has a 2000 characters limit)
                                </p> 
                                <p>This program was written in C#, on Visual Studio, using the DiscordNet library to communicate with the Discord API.
                                     The bot has a few commands used to configure itself, all accessible with the prefix "*" when typing a message.
                                </p>

                                <h1>PFD on a tablet</h1>
                                <p>This is a 2 months school project I did in my third year of Licence, with a team of 5 students.
                                    The goal of this project was to create a Primary Flight Display (PFD) on a touch pad screen controlled
                                    with a Raspberry Pi 4. It had its own battery and sensors to make this fully portable and flight ready.
                                </p> 
                                <p>My task was to create the User Interface, so I decided to program this in C++ using the help of the SFML Library.
                                    I had to design and allow animations for many flight intruments and even an artificial horizon. I also made
                                    use of the touch sensitive screen and added multiple layouts and configurations to improve the user's experience.
                                </p>
